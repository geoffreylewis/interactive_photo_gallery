# Interactive Photo Gallery

## Software Summary

I built an image gallery (with a mobile-first design) that has two key functions: a search bar that filters through the images based on the keywords you type in, and a lightbox that blows up the images in size so you can scroll through them one by one.  I wrote some jQuery for the search bar's filtering functionality, and I attached the "Magnific Popup" plugin (with some slight CSS tweaks of my own) for the lightbox.

## Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript / jQuery

## Additional Notes

* All of the HTML/CSS code has been successfully run through the W3C HTML/CSS validators; there are no errors.
* All of the JavaScript/jQuery has been successfully run through JSHint; it only marks the "$" as an undefined variable.
* The version of jQuery that I am using is v3.3.1 from http://jquery.com/download/.
* I downloaded the .zip file containing the Magnific Popup lightbox plugin from https://github.com/dimsemenov/Magnific-Popup, and I followed their instructions/documentation at http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/documentation.html.
